Project Description
A virtual potato friend who listens, reacts to your emotions, counts its own spots, dances when happy, and occasionally shares the heart-wrenching story of its cousin who became French fries.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Loneliness is real‚Ä¶ but not as real as the tragedy of owning a potato that doesn‚Äôt blink, dance, keep track of its majestic dots, or work through its French fry-related trauma with emotional support.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made an emotionally intelligent potato that can:

Wiggle

Dance joyfully when in ‚Äúhappy‚Äù mode

Count and report its number of spots/holes/freckles for absolutely no reason

React to your mood

Be comforted when feeling sad (you can click/tap to ‚Äúhug‚Äù it)

Open up about the trauma of losing its beloved cousin‚Ä¶ who was cruelly turned into French fries at a local fast-food chain

Engage in a short, dramatic conversation with said cousin in the afterlife of starch
