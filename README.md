## Project Description  
A virtual potato friend who listens, reacts to your emotions, counts its own spots, dances when happy, and occasionally shares the heart-wrenching story of its cousin who became French fries.  

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
💔 Loneliness is real… but not as real as the tragedy of **owning a potato that doesn’t blink, dance, keep track of its majestic dots, or work through its French fry-related trauma with emotional support**.  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We made an emotionally intelligent potato that can:  

- 🌀 **Wiggle**  
- 💃 **Dance joyfully** when in “happy” mode  
- 🔍 **Count and report its number of spots/holes/freckles** for absolutely no reason  
- 😄 **React to your mood**  
- 🤗 **Be comforted when feeling sad** (click/tap to “hug” it)  
- 🥀 **Open up about the trauma** of losing its beloved cousin… who was cruelly turned into French fries at a local fast-food chain  
- 🎭 **Engage in a short, dramatic conversation** with said cousin in the afterlife of starch
